        <h3>Some info about the game </h3>
  <p>
    League of Legends (LoL), commonly referred to as League, is a 2009 multiplayer online battle arena video game developed
    and published by Riot Games. Inspired by Defense of the Ancients, a custom map for Warcraft III, Riot's founders sought
    to develop a stand-alone game in the same genre. Since its release in October 2009, League has been free-to-play and is
    monetized through purchasable character customization. The game is available for Microsoft Windows and macOS.
  </p>
  <p>
    In the game, two teams of five players battle in player-versus-player combat, each team occupying and defending their
    half of the map. Each of the ten players controls a character, known as a "champion", with unique abilities and
    differing styles of play. During a match, champions become more powerful by collecting experience points, earning gold,
    and purchasing items to defeat the opposing team. In League's main mode, Summoner's Rift, a team wins by pushing through
    to the enemy base and destroying their "Nexus", a large structure located within.

    <p>
    Summoner's Rift is the flagship game mode of League of Legends and the most prominent in professional-level
    play. The mode has a ranked competitive ladder; a matchmaking system determines a player's skill level and
    generates a starting rank from which they can climb. There are ten tiers; the least skilled are Iron, Bronze, and
    Silver, and the highest are Master, Grandmaster, and Challenger.
    
    Two teams of five players compete to destroy the opposing team's "Nexus", which is guarded by the enemy champions and
    defensive structures known as "turrets".Each team's Nexus is located in their base, where players start the game
    and reappear after death.Non-player characters known as minions are generated from each team's Nexus and advance
    towards the enemy base along three lanes guarded by turrets: top, middle, and bottom. Each team's base contains
    three "inhibitors", one behind the third tower from the center of each lane. Destroying one of the enemy team's
    inhibitors causes stronger allied minions to spawn in that lane, and allows the attacking team to damage the enemy Nexus
    and the two turrets guarding it. The regions in between the lanes are collectively known as the "jungle", which is
    inhabited by "monsters" that, like minions, respawn at regular intervals. Like minions, monsters provide gold and XP
    when killed.Another, more powerful class of monster resides within the river that separates each team's jungle.
    These monsters require multiple players to defeat and grant special abilities to their slayers' team. For example, teams
    can gain a powerful allied unit after killing the Rift Herald, permanent strength boosts by killing dragons, and
    stronger, more durable minions by killing Baron Nashor.
    
    Summoner's Rift matches can last from as little as 15 minutes to over an hour. Although the game does not enforce
    where players may go, conventions have arisen over the game's lifetime: typically one player goes in the top lane, one
    in the middle lane, one in the jungle, and two in the bottom lane. Players in a lane kill minions to
    accumulate gold and XP (termed "farming") and try to prevent their opponent from doing the same. A fifth champion, known
    as a "jungler", farms the jungle monsters and, when powerful enough, assists their teammates in a lane.
